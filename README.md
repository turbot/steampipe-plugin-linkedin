## Quick start

Install the plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```shell
steampipe plugin install linkedin
```

Configure your token (from browser cookies) in `~/.steampipe/config/linkedin.spc`:

```hcl
connection "linkedin" {
  plugin  = "linkedin"
  // Set to value of the `li_at` cookie from a logged in LinkedIn browser session
  token   = "BQEDBQBCO8wBpUgWBBBBhhBtNDUBBBFFNDm4NU4BzcB32MRFFNDdx9md-Qk9_IFs6Lo4z8gTYb5HqUC5h-OjVDM22UiRUgjYX7CrYZw_IMIg6qUICOqqeCzjnb1tqIBIi7_HTZ3z2g_jq3JEqNjzqL7g"
}
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

Run a query:

```sql
select
  id,
  title,
  headline
from
  linkedin_company_employee
where
  company_id = 7599466
  and query = 'dave';
```

```
+----------+--------------+----------+
| id       | title        | headline |
+----------+--------------+----------+
| 13016000 | David Jones  | CTO      |
|  4819034 | Dave Beecham | Engineer |
